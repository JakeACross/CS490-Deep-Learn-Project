    "### This program utilizes OpenCV to gather face images for a facial recognition dataset.\n",
    "### How it works is by prompting the user to enter in the user's name. This name is designated as the folder name for the dataset. The image path is created using my custom location. To have this successfully run on a different computer, simply change image_path to wherever you want to save your images to. Once the path is established, the program begins taking pictures looking for faces. It saves the face your are trying to train into 150 256 x 256 cropped images. These images are saved into the path and folder that the program creates. This makes it easy to copy and transport these folders to design a facial recognition dataset."
